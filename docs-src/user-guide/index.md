# User guide

The user guide focuses on weak-IV robust inference workflows, from data setup to
publication-ready plots.

## What you will learn

- How `IVData` structures the model and assumptions.
- When to prefer AR, LM/K, or CLR inference.
- How to interpret diagnostics and effective F statistics.
- How to interpret diagnostics and safe defaults for reporting.
- How to report set-valued confidence sets and p-value curves.
