# User guide

This guide focuses on:

1. The data model (`IVData`) and what ivrobust assumes.
2. Anderson-Rubin tests and confidence sets (weak-IV robust).
3. Diagnostics and reporting practices.
4. Plotting conventions for publication-quality output.

The guiding principle is correct inference under weak instruments.
